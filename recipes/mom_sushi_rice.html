                    <h4>Steps 1</h4>
                    <p>Place rice into a large, deep bowl. Fill with cold water and rub rice together with hands until water turns milky white.
                    Pour off cloudy water, being careful not to pour out rice. 
                    Repeat 3 or 4 times until you can see rice through 3 inches of water.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Steps 2</h4>
                    <p>Drain rice in a fine strainer, then place into a saucepan along with konbu and 3 cups water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes. 
                    Stir together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved in a small bowl; set aside.</p>
                </li>  
                <li>
                    <h4>Steps 3</h4>
                    <p>Cover, and bring rice to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes. 
                    Remove from heat and allow to stand, covered, for 5 minutes.</p>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <h4>Steps 4</h4>
                    <p>Scrape rice into a bowl; remove and discard konbu. 
                    Stir in vinegar mixture until well incorporated and no lumps of rice remain. Allow to cool at room temperature. 
                    For a shinier appearance, use an electric fan to cool rice rapidly.</p>
